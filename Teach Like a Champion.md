# How to teach like a Champion

## Part 1: Gathering data on student mastery
---

## 1. Reject self report

> Replace functionally rhetorical questions with more objective forms of impromtu assessment

Functionally rhetorical questions:
- Got it guys?
- Everyone understand?

Replace these with questions that test for understanding

Another thing you can do is replace self-report withs self-monitoring. Self-monitoring is intentional reflection on your own level of understanding. E.g. "Everyone take 1 minute to skim back over the notes from today and find one thing that you'd like to ask a question about."

## 2. Ask targeted questions
> Quickly ask a series of carefully chosen, open ended questions directed at a **strategic sample** of the class.

Compared to self-monitoring, this technique is a less time expensive way to check for understanding. Asking targeted questions should take 1-2 minutes.



Asking a strategic sample:
- Ask questions to some who you expect to be struggling, some who are flying and some in the middle to get a cross sectional estimate of how things are going

- Ask 5-6 people

- Ask tough questions to those who can elaborate it clearly in a way that might give the class another perspective.




Planning questions
- You should plan these questions in advance in your lesson plan.

- You should plan when these questions will be asked in your lesson, and make sure you only move on when you are confident of understanding. It's more efficient to reteach now rather than having to reteach something built on these shaky foundations later.

Instead of waiting for volunteers, "cold call" people. This maintains engagement, and unbiases your checks for understanding.

#### Example:

---

You: John, How is classification data different to regression data?

John: ** answers **

You: That's right! Great work

You: Kayse, Any what's the difference in the model that we need to use?

Kayse: ** answers **

You: Great, it looks like we're ready to move on!

## 3. Standardize the format
> Streamline observations by designing materials so that you're looking in the same consistent place every time for the data you need

Standardizing the format allows you to:
- check for understanding without having to interrupt with questions.
- concentrate on identifying trends in student work, rather than digging for information

## 4. Don't just watch, track
> Be intentional about how you scan your classroom. Decide specifically what you're looking for and remain disciplined about it in the face of distraction.

There are hundreds of aspects of student work that you could comment on, but you need to be intentionally looking for and providing feedback on the key things which are most important before anything else.

List the "specific errors" and "success points" in your lesson plan. Plan responses to specific errors you expect.

Occurences of specific errors or success points should be recorded to inform what needs to be retaught and how the lesson plan needs to be iterated.

## 5. Show me
> Have student actively show evidence of their understanding.

This features students **showing their teacher** **objective data** on **their work** **in unison**

2 formats:
- hand signals (or emoji) to show data on answers
- slates (actual working out)

## 6. Affirmative Checking
> Insert specific points into your lesson when students must get confirmation that their work is correct, or sufficiently rigorous before moving on.

Checking should be very quick, so that you don't have people saying "I'm just waiting to be checked". Have a rubric ready and know what you are looking for.

You don't want several students to be asked to be checked at the same time, as some will be left waiting. One way around this is to check them after a few questions rather than one; the differences in total completion time will have a greater variance over several questions, and hence spread out the checking.

Define a way for students to signal that they need to be checked while they continue to work. E.g show an emoji raised hand.

## Part 2: Acting on the Data and the Culture of Error
---

## 7. Plan for Error

> Increase the likelihood that you'll recognize and respond to errors by planning common mistakes in advance.

Predicting a single, specific error is difficult; predicting broadly is not.

Having more questions than can possibly be completed allows you to cater to students who can blast through them quickly without them having to wait around whilst slower students struggle. Once the slowest students have completed the key challenges, then you can move on.

By having more problems than can reasonably be completed and ordering them by difficulty, you can adapt the class to the skill level of the students - skipping ahead a few questions or going through each of them if needed. "Choose your own adventure" style.

Just because plan out the lesson in advance, doesn't mean you have to stick to it. By intentionally checking for understanding at specific points in the lesson (#6), you can adapt it based on the data. After every few problems, ask: "Should I loop back for more, push on, or re-teach this?". This allows you to respond to error with very little transaction cost or on-the-spot rethinking - it was all in the planning!

"Anticipating errors and planning responses to them is one of the most productive training or planning exercises you can do as a teacher. If the students make mistakes you anticipate, you're likely to have a terrific solution; if you're wrong, you get to improve your level of insight about your students' thinking by reflecting on the dissonance between the errors you anticipated and the mistakes that actually occured"
