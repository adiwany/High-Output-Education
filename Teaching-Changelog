# Teaching changelog


WIP
- Defined an actual process for navigating around the rooms
- Project based pathways

- Add a new rule: every student has to see at least one of the teaching team during every session
- Implement immediate feedback for anyone who gives a demo at end of meeting - what a fantastic way to train them
- First alumni engineer (Eddy) asks questions based on those defined in the content
- Starting to feel like notebooks are a limiting format. Sometimes you need to do practicals mid-way through, rather than reading the whole noebook, and then doing all of the practicals.
