# Teaching Techniques

The following are my notes on Doug Lemov's work in Teach Like a Champion.

## Part 1: Gathering data on student mastery
---

## 1. Reject self report

> Replace functionally rhetorical questions with more objective forms of impromtu assessment

Examples of common functionally rhetorical questions:
- "Got it guys?"
- "Everyone understand?"

Replace these with questions that test for understanding

Another thing you can do is replace self-report withs self-monitoring. Self-monitoring is intentional reflection on your own level of understanding. E.g. "Everyone take 1 minute to skim back over the notes from today and find one thing that you'd like to ask a question about."

## 2. Ask targeted questions
> Quickly ask a series of carefully chosen, open ended questions directed at a **strategic sample** of the class.

Compared to self-monitoring, this technique is a less time expensive way to check for understanding. Asking targeted questions should take 1-2 minutes.



Asking a strategic sample:
- Ask questions to some who you expect to be struggling, some who are flying and some in the middle to get a cross sectional estimate of how things are going

- Ask 5-6 people

- Ask tough questions to those who can elaborate it clearly in a way that might give the class another perspective.




Planning questions
- You should plan these questions in advance in your lesson plan.

- You should plan when these questions will be asked in your lesson, and make sure you only move on when you are confident of understanding. It's more efficient to reteach now rather than having to reteach something built on these shaky foundations later.

Instead of waiting for volunteers, "cold call" people. This maintains engagement, and unbiases your checks for understanding.

#### Example:

---

You: John, How is classification data different to regression data?

John: ** answers **

You: That's right! Great work

You: Kayse, Any what's the difference in the model that we need to use?

Kayse: ** answers **

You: Great, it looks like we're ready to move on!

---

## 3. Standardize the format
> Streamline observations by designing materials so that you're looking in the same consistent place every time for the data you need

Standardizing the format allows you to:
- check for understanding without having to interrupt with questions.
- concentrate on identifying trends in student work, rather than digging for information

## 4. Don't just watch, track
> Be intentional about how you scan your classroom. Decide specifically what you're looking for and remain disciplined about it in the face of distraction.

There are hundreds of aspects of student work that you could comment on, but you need to be intentionally looking for and providing feedback on the key things which are most important before anything else.

List the "specific errors" and "success points" in your lesson plan. Plan responses to specific errors you expect.

Occurences of specific errors or success points should be recorded to inform what needs to be retaught and how the lesson plan needs to be iterated.

## 5. Show me
> Have student actively show evidence of their understanding.

This features students **showing their teacher** **objective data** on **their work** **in unison**

2 formats:
- hand signals (or emoji) to show data on answers
- slates (actual working out)

## 6. Affirmative Checking
> Insert specific points into your lesson when students must get confirmation that their work is correct, or sufficiently rigorous before moving on.

Checking should be very quick, so that you don't have people saying "I'm just waiting to be checked". Have a rubric ready and know what you are looking for.

You don't want several students to be asked to be checked at the same time, as some will be left waiting. One way around this is to check them after a few questions rather than one; the differences in total completion time will have a greater variance over several questions, and hence spread out the checking.

Define a way for students to signal that they need to be checked while they continue to work. E.g show an emoji raised hand.

## Part 2: Acting on the Data and the Culture of Error
---

## 7. Plan for Error

> Increase the likelihood that you'll recognize and respond to errors by planning common mistakes in advance.

Predicting a single, specific error is difficult; predicting broadly is not.

Having more questions than can possibly be completed allows you to cater to students who can blast through them quickly without them having to wait around whilst slower students struggle. Once the slowest students have completed the key challenges, then you can move on.

By having more problems than can reasonably be completed and ordering them by difficulty, you can adapt the class to the skill level of the students - skipping ahead a few questions or going through each of them if needed. "Choose your own adventure" style.

Just because you plan out the lesson in advance, doesn't mean you have to stick to it. By intentionally checking for understanding at specific points in the lesson (#6), you can adapt it based on the data. After every few problems, ask yourself: "Should I loop back for more, push on, or re-teach this?". This allows you to respond to error with very little transaction cost or on-the-spot rethinking - it was all in the planning!

"Anticipating errors and planning responses to them is one of the most productive training or planning exercises you can do as a teacher. If the students make mistakes you anticipate, you're likely to have a terrific solution; if you're wrong, you get to improve your level of insight about your students' thinking by reflecting on the dissonance between the errors you anticipated and the mistakes that actually occured"

### How to plan for specific errors:
1. List 3-5 of the most important questions you will ask in your lesson
2. For each question, list two incorrect answers you think you're likely to get
3. Add how you'd respond to each of the incorrect answers in your lesson plan

### How to plan for classwide misunderstandings:

Plan a minute of targeted questions (#2) followed by 5 minutes of "either-or time" in the lesson plan where you'll either
1. reteach content students are struggling with
2. or do further practice

## 8. Culture of Error
> Create an environment where your students feel safe making and discussing mistakes, so you can spend less time hunting for errors and more time fixing them.

How to build a culture of error:
1. Ask students to nominate problems
2. Don't react to incorrect answers - demonstrate that is what you expect by never faltering.
3. Verbally reward cross-class support and make the class feel like a team by using language like:
    - "Great to see so many of you wishing to help and share their expertise"
    - "Who can help out?"
    - "Great opportunity for us to work together to figure it out. Can anyone pick up from here?"

    Avoid:
    - "Anyone else?"
    - "Let's see if someone else can get it right"
4. Verbally reward admitting mistakes that students learn from by saying something like "Can whoever initially got it wrong, but corrected themselves put their hand up - be proud you guys just figured it out!"
5. 


Reset breeches of culture of error. If anyone reacts unsupportively to another student making an error, it is your responsibility to firmly reiterate the standard. You can say something like: "Just a minute. I want to be very clear about the respect we will all show one another when we are in class. We will support each other and help one another. And we will never, ever tear down another person. We know that person could just as well be us."

How you communicate and depict mistakes - both your students' AND your own - in the classroom is very important.

### How to implement a Culture of Error
1. Expect error
    - "I expect there's going to be some disagreement here, so I want to hear a few answers." ... "Are there any other answers out there?"


2. Withold the Answer

    Students don't listen when they know they are listening to the wrong answer, even if the dicsussion around it might be useful. Take several answers even if you recieve the one you wanted, and delay revealing the correct answer until after you've discussed it.

    - "I don't care if you think it's right or wrong, I just want to hear what people think"

3. Manage the tell

    Be careful of habits of yours that may be triggered in response to recieving an incorrect answer, without you saying so explicitly, other students might be able to tell that the answer was wrong - and disengage as a result.

4. Praise Risk-Taking
    - "This is a tough question! Who will be bold enough to start us off?"
    - "Who wants to take a shot at our challenge question?. I love those seeing those brave hands"


## 9. Excavate Error

> Dig into errors, studying them efficiently and effectively, to better understand where students struggle and how you can best address those points.

Diagnose errors when they come up and ask why that error was made. If you can do that, you will understand how to approach reteaching the idea now, and improve delivery of the same or similar material in the future.

Choose one of the following 3 levels of excavating error based on what is most efficient for class.

1. Assess and Move
    Sometimes you may notice a mistake which may not warrant reteaching the entire class, especially if it is not revealed in a whole class activity. In this case, you might choose to keep moving forward and then check in with those who are struggling during periods of independent work. This allows you to 
    - respect the time of everyone who might not need to be retaught by not interrupting another activity or diverting a lesson
    - privately address any issues which might otherwise be embarrassing, rather than making an example out of someone in front of the class
2. Light Excavation
    If more than several students made the same mistake, or there is real value in the error, it can be valuable to bring them up in front of the class. To do this you can
    - Ask for an alternative response, without revealing which is correct. "Can anyone else share another interpretation?"
    - Compare responses by stating two given opinions and asking "Who can find evidence to support or rule out one of these answers?"
    - Analyze wrong choices "What might lead someone to incorrectly think X?"
    - Ask for a proposed response. "Let's say I found this hard to understand. What might be the reasons for that? What mistakes might I have made?" 
3. Deep Excavation
    Sometimes it may not be obvious on the surface what the cause of the error was, and whether it affected many or only few students. In this case you may want to do a deep excavation, by looking at lots of answers and clustering errors systematically. 
    
    When asking for more answers it is important, as mentioned earlier (#8) to manage the tell, and not give away the mistake or right answer.
    
Frequently ask "What is the most important question I am asking today?" and anticipate the likely errors. Leave a chunk of time in your lesson to dive into them. Add this to your lesson plan.

Deeper excavation is not necessarily better, and the optimum is a balance between the types.

## 10. Own and track

> Have students correct or revise their own work, fostering an environment of accountability for the correct answer.

Students must __own__ their mistakes and be accountable for marking them as incorrect. 

Students must __track__ their mistakes, rather than just removing them so that they can remember and refer to them.
Explicitly ask students to mark any incorrect answers as correct by crossing (or commenting) out any incorrect answers and marking them with an explanation for why they are incorrect. 
It's important that incorrect answers are not simply removed, because then there is no record of what mistake was made and how. 
Instead have them retain the mistake, visually mark it as incorrect and annotate it with an explanation.
This annotation also helps to prevent confusing students whether the response is right or wrong, and which parts of it specifically are wrong.

## Part 2: Academic Ethos

## 11. No opt out

> Turn "I don't know" into success by ensuring that students who won't try or can't answer practice getting it right.

Circle back to a student who won't try after providing more scaffolding or getting an answer from another student.

This is the fundamental process of learning: Get it wrong, then get it right.



You know to use "No Opt Out" when you ask a question to a student and get "I don't know" as a response. Following that, do the following:
1. Turn to another student
